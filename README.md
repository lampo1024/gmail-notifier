# GmailNotifier.NET

This program is similar to the now discontinued Gmail Notifier from Google. It displays a mail icon in the Windows 
notification area which highlights when you have new unread messages in your Gmail inbox. It uses Microsoft.NET 
4.0 and the Gmail API. When you run it for the first time it will ask you to grant permissons to your Gmail 
through OAuth2.
